# Node Sandbox
My full stack (almost) frameworkless JS playground for tinkering on new stuff.  So far includes:  

- a reusable resource router for managing database resources in mySQL
- a socket.io chat server with messsages saved to a mongoDb instance  
- OpenAI API chat integration (chat respones and keyword scraping)
- updated frontend with native Web Components and native CustomEvent pub/sub 
- streaming system updates with Server Side (Push) Events 
- a simple JWT & bcrypt based authentication with a tiered feature set. 
- a nightly job to delete all of the day's chats
- new production pipeline using [Render](https://render.com/), [HelioHost](https://heliohost.org/), and [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database)
